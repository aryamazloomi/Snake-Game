# Snake-Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module. The game allows players to control a snake, collect food to grow longer, and avoid collisions with the borders. The project includes a visual update to make the game more aesthetically pleasing.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake using keyboard inputs (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`) to move up, left, down, and right respectively.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the player's current score and high score.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Run the `snake.py` file in a Python environment.

2. **Controls**:
   - Use `W` to move the snake up.
   - Use `A` to move the snake left.
   - Use `S` to move the snake down.
   - Use `D` to move the snake right.

3. **Objective**:
   - Guide the snake to collect food (apple) to grow longer.
   - Avoid collisions with the borders to keep playing.
